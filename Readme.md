## Most of this work is presented on my Medium Publication: https://medium.com/datadream

Find out which west coast city has the most [Breweries per Capita](https://medium.com/datadream/beer-boroughs-f9432e1859d3).

Some of the work is for assignments from the recently completed [Data Science Professional Certification from IBM](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ibm-data-science-professional-certificate)

See the 'NameCompare' in the Project repo - a set of scripts I wrote to assist with comparing lists of users with lists of current employees (used for SOX compliance audits)
